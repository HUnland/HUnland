Hi, Iâ€™m @HUnland.
I am a German retired developer. Retired because I could no longer concentrate on my work. But in the meantime my condition has improved and I can program again.

I have experience in Java for desktop and server. Also in databases (SQL) and browsers (HTML, CSS, JavaScript ...). In May 2021 - after some years of break - I tried to write a little program and saw that I'm back again. So I started writing of a little graphics program for APNG in Java/JavaFX and now (September 2021) it is complete and available for download.
